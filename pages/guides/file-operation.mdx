# File Operation

To prevent directory traversal and access to sensitive files, use the wrapper functions provided by Waffle.

## When using `os`

If you are using the `os` package to perform file operations, replace it with the `waffle-go/contrib/os` package.


```go
import (
    ...
    "os"
    waffleOs "github.com/sitebatch/waffle-go/contrib/os"
    ...
)

func someReadFileFunc() {
    // insted of os.ReadFile
    // ctx MUST be a context propagated from Waffle HTTP server middleware such as WafMiddleware
    waffleOs.ProtectReadFile(ctx, path)
}
```

More information can be found in the [`contrib/os`](https://github.com/sitebatch/waffle-go/tree/main/contrib/os).
