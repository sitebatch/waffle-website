# HTTP Client

When sending a request from your application to another service, you can prevent attacks such as SSRF by using Waffle.

## When using `net/http`

To prevent attacks such as SSRF, use the `waffle-go/contrib/net/http` package.

```go
import (
    ...
    "net/http"
    waffleHttp "github.com/sitebatch/waffle-go/contrib/net/http"
    ...
)

func doRequest() {
    ...
	c := waffleHttp.WrapClient(http.DefaultClient)
    // ctx MUST be a context propagated from Waffle HTTP server middleware such as WafMiddleware
	req, _ := http.NewRequestWithContext(ctx, "GET", "http://169.254.169.254/", nil)
    ...
}
```
