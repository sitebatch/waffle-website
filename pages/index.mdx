# Waffle

Waffle is a library that provides in-app WAF (Web Application Firewall) and RASP (Runtime Application Self Protection) capabilities for your Go web applications.

## Features:

- Adapts to your application stack without configuration
- Protects against common attacks like injection, XSS, and account takeover
- Context-aware precise detection

## Use-cases:

- Protect your application from common attacks
- Monitor and log security events
- Use as an alternative to Cloud-based WAF
- Focus on protection from threats, not adjusting WAF rules

## Integration:

Waffle supports integration with major libraries. For more information, see [Support Libraries](/guides/support-libraries).

## Protect critical application vulnerabilities:

Waffle prevent the exploitation of vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and SSRF based on context. It considers the application's logic and data flow, such as query execution and file opening, to perform accurate detection.  
For more information, see [Concepts](/concepts/operation-context-propagation).
