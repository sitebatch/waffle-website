# Business Logic

Waffle provides a protection layer for application-specific processing. It can detect malicious login attempts such as credential stuffing and abnormal payment requests.

```go
// Example:

import (
    "github.com/sitebatch/waffle-go/contrib/application"
)

// Apply rate limiting based on client IP and user ID key to
// detect attacks such as credential stuffing
if err := application.ProtectAccountTakeover(ctx, clientIP, email); err != nil {
    return err
}

err := login(ctx, email, password)
if err != nil {
    return err
}
```
